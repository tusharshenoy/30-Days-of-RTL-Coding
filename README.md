# RTL-Day-23-ALU
### Problem Statement: Implementing 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in Behavioural Style of Modelling.
### Theory:
An ALU, or Arithmetic Logic Unit, is a fundamental component of a central 
processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor in a computer. It is responsible for 
performing arithmetic and logic operations on binary data. The primary 
functions of an ALU include:

#### 1. Arithmetic Operations:
 Addition: Adding two binary numbers to produce a sum.

 Subtraction: Subtracting one binary number from another to produce a difference.

 Multiplication: Multiplying two binary numbers to produce a product.

 Division: Dividing one binary number by another to produce a quotient and a remainder.


#### 2. Logic Operations:
 AND: Performing a bitwise AND operation on two binary numbers. The result is 1 if both corresponding bits are 1; otherwise, it's 0.

 OR: Performing a bitwise OR operation on two binary numbers. The result is 1 if at least one corresponding bit is 1.

 XOR (Exclusive OR): Performing a bitwise XOR operation on two binary numbers. The result is 1 if the corresponding bits are different; otherwise, it's 0.

 NOT: Performing a bitwise NOT operation on a binary number. It flips each bit (1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1).


#### 3. Comparison Operations:
 Equal: Comparing two binary numbers to check if they are equal.

 Not Equal: Checking if two binary numbers are not equal.

 Less Than: Determining if one binary number is less than another.

 Greater Than: Determining if one binary number is greater than another.


Only Arithmetic Operation has been implemented.
