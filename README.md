# RTL-Day-27-16x4-ROM
### Problem Statement: Implementing a 16x4 ROM.
### Theory:
ROM

Read-only memory (ROM) is a data storage device used in personal 
computers (PCs) and other electronic devices to store information securely. 
It houses programs or software instructions and includes the programming 
required to start a computer, which is required for boot-up. It also conducts 
significant input/output duties. The alteration of this sort of memory, known 
as "firmware," has been a source of design concern throughout the growth 
of the contemporary computer.

Because ROM is read-only memory, it can't be modified; it's also permanent 
and non-volatile, which means it keeps its data even if the power is turned 
off. Random-access memory (RAM), on the other hand, is volatile; when 
power is turned off, it is gone. The phrase "non-volatile memory," which is 
comparable, can be applied here. In its long-term state, ROM in computer 
is "stateful," whereas RAM is "stateless."

#### ROM in Computer has the Following Characteristics:

 Non-volatile memory is referred to as ROM.

 The information saved in ROM is irreversible.

 We can only read the information and applications stored on it.

 In binary format, information and applications are stored on ROM.

 It's utilized throughout the computer's boot-up procedure.

#### Types of ROM

They are four types of ROM in the computer:

 MROM (Masked read-only memory)

 PROM (Programmable read-only memory)

 EPROM (Erasable programmable read-only memory)

 EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
