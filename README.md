# RTL-Day-18-Comparator-Behavioral
### Problem Statement: Implementing Comparator in Behavioural style of Implementation.

#### Theory:
### 1-Bit Magnitude Comparator
A comparator used to compare two bits is called a single-bit 
comparator. It consists of two inputs each for two single-bit 
numbers and three outputs to generate less than, equal to, and 
greater than between two binary numbers.

### 2-Bit Magnitude Comparator
A comparator used to compare two binary numbers each of two 
bits is called a 2-bit Magnitude comparator. It consists of four 
inputs and three outputs to generate less than, equal to, and greater 
than between two binary numbers.

### 4-Bit Magnitude Comparator
A comparator used to compare two binary numbers each of four 
bits is called a 4-bit magnitude comparator. It consists of eight 
inputs each for two four-bit numbers and three outputs to generate 
less than, equal to, and greater than between two binary numbers.
