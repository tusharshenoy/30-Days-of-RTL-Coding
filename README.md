# RTL-Day-7-2-Bit-Binary-Multiplier

### Problem Statement: Implementing a 2-Bit Binary Multiplier using Structural Style of Implementation and to display the Test Case Status.
### Theory: 
A binary multiplier definition is; an electronic device or digital device or a combinational logic circuit that performs the multiplication of two binary numbers (0 and 1). The two binary numbers or the two binary inputs used in the binary multiplication are multiplicand and multiplier to get the binary product as a result.
The bit size of the multiplier and the multiplicand can be varied. But the bit size of the binary product depends on the multiplier and the multiplicand bit size. The sum of the multiplier and the multiplicand bit size is equal to the final binary product’s bit size.
Function of Binary Multiplier
In the first step of the process of the binary multiplier, the partial product terms are obtained by the bit by bit multiplication, which is equal to the ANDing of two binary numbers. In the next step, all the partial product terms of each column are added together to get the final binary product output.
The logic circuit design of this multiplier varies with bit size and its complexity increases with an increase in the multiplier’s bit size. It is governed by the AND gate functions when the two bits, which are to be multiplied, are fed as inputs with various bit sizes.
The main function of this multiplier is to do binary multiplication of 2 binary numbers with various bit sizes and reduce the calculation time in electronic digital systems such as computers. The binary multiplication is similar to the decimal multiplication.
